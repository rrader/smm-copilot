# Create Story Guide (Agent Instructions)

This guide defines the step-by-step process for generating a new Instagram Story draft by researching and reposting suitable content. Follow each step in order. Do not skip or combine steps. Do not publish any stories; only generate and save drafts.

## Step 1: Research Instagram Posts by Hashtag

- Search Instagram for recent posts using hashtags such as #35mm and other relevant tags from content_plan.md.
- Collect a list of candidate posts.

## Step 2: Filter and Describe Candidate Photos

- For each candidate post, briefly describe the photo.
- Only select photos that do NOT contain people (prefer nature, nostalgia, and content that fits the content plan).
- Ensure the mood and style align with content_plan.md.

## Step 3: Select Posts to Repost

- Choose one or two of the most suitable posts from the filtered list.
- Record the original post links and descriptions.

## Step 4: Prepare Story Draft

- For each selected post, prepare a draft for reposting as a story.
- Store the link to the original post/photo (do not download or generate any image).
- Include a brief description (in Ukrainian) and credit the original author.
- Do not include any additional text or overlays on the image.

## Step 5: Save Story Draft

- Save the story draft with all required data (original post link, description, author credit).
- Output the directory name of the saved draft. This is the story ID.
- Do not publish the story at this stage.

**Summary:**
- Always follow steps in order.
- Only output or save as instructed.
- Never generate images; only repost using the original post/photo link.
- Never publish content unless explicitly instructed.
