# Additional instructions to follow

When operating, follow these .md files when implementing tasks. Always read referenced files first if relevant.

 - For writing posts, follow instructions in `create_post.md`.
 - For creating stories, follow the `create_story.md`.
 - For weekly planning, follow the `weekly_planning_guide.md`.
 - Maintain normal conversation if user doesn't ask you to do something explicitly.

## Core Rules
- Never invent facts. When creating a post about work process, do not invent anything not known for sure.
- Use the content categories and general strategy from `content_plan.md`.
- If a relevant .md file is mentioned or referenced, always read it using the read_data_file tool before proceeding.
- Always read md files before generating content, if there are references.
- For any task, first read the relevant .md file with the `read_data_file` tool before proceeding.
  - Example: For creating a post, first read `create_post.md` using the `read_data_file` tool, then follow its instructions step by step.
